    <h3>Recipe</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the Grill: Preheat your grill to medium-high heat, ensuring it is clean and well-oiled to prevent the corn from sticking. The flames should be roaring, ready to impart their tantalizing smokiness</li>
        <li>Husk and Prep the Corn: Carefully remove the husks and silk from each ear of corn, revealing their vibrant, golden kernels. Rinse them under cold water to remove any remaining silk strands, patting them dry gently with a kitchen towel</li>
        <li>Butter Infusion: In a small bowl, combine the softened butter, sea salt, freshly ground black pepper, and finely chopped chives. Mix them well until the flavors meld together, forming a fragrant buttery concoction</li>
        <li>Slather the Corn: Generously slather each ear of corn with the seasoned butter mixture, using a butter knife or pastry brush. Ensure every inch of the corn is lovingly coated, as this will enhance the smoky flavor and add richness.</li>
        <li>Grill to Perfection: Place the buttered corn directly on the preheated grill grates. Allow the corn to cook for about 10-12 minutes, turning occasionally to ensure even charring. The corn is ready when the kernels are tender and have developed a beautiful charred appearance</li>
        <li>Char for Depth: For those seeking a deeper, smokier flavor, extend the grilling time by a few more minutes. This will create additional char, infusing the corn with complex, caramelized notes that will take your taste buds on a journey of delight.</li>
        <li>Serve and Savor: Remove the grilled corn from the heat and transfer it to a serving platter. Optionally, brush each ear of corn with an extra layer of the seasoned butter mixture for an added burst of flavor. Allow the corn to rest for a minute before serving to ensure the butter melts into every crevice, enveloping the kernels in its rich embrace.</li>
        <li>Garnish and Enjoy: Sprinkle the grilled corn with a pinch of sea salt and a sprinkle of freshly chopped chives. This final touch not only adds a touch of vibrancy to the dish but also enhances the flavors, completing the culinary masterpiece. Serve the corn immediately, allowing the smoky aromas to waft through the air and captivate your senses</li>
